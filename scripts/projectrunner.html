            In 2022 there was a special week to make people work together and create some form of project physical of digital.
            <br><br>
            We as a team choose to make a game about shoplifting. We make them realize that you never can outrun the police and it will only become harder the longer you run.
            <br><br>
            One cool thing is the longer u run the heavier your sentence is. There is one where you do not get accepted in your job because of your theft.
            <br> <br>
            I programmed the game alone because I was the only programmer. My team made the assets and background which where very nicely done. The most important part was the teamwork, and it was amazing everybody was positive and we all where on a straight line. A very cool and fun experience to say the least
