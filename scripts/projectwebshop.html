            Chapter 1: Idea to Blueprint
            <br>
            In the world of web development, my goal was to create a webshop. It all began with a basic idea: a place for shopping, adding items to a cart, and seeing the total cost. But first, I needed a plan. I crafted a wireframe, a visual blueprint, to guide my way.
            <br><br>
            Chapter 2: The Power of JavaScript
            <br>
            The heart of my webshop was its shopping cart, and JavaScript was the key. With JavaScript, users could easily add products, adjust quantities, and instantly calculate the total cost. It added vitality to the cart.
            <br><br>
            Adding Products: JavaScript made the "Add to Cart" button work like magic.
            Updating the Cart: The cart dynamically adjusted as customers modified quantities or removed items.
            Total Cost Calculation: JavaScript ensured accurate total cost calculations.
            This journey was a story of creativity, challenges, and the enchantment of JavaScript, transforming a simple idea into a functional webshop that offered customers a smooth shopping experience.
