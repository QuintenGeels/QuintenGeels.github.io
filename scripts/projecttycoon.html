            In my first year 2022 I created my own game called tycoon.
            <br><br>
            Well, I called it that because it is a tycoon you earn money by clicking the click button. You can also automate it so it will automatically click for you. With more money you can buy more buildings and earn more until you have everything.
            <br><br>
            I work for the first real time on my own I think I got a great idea and just went straight into it. So, I had nothing holding me back and I created this in 3 weeks. I learned to plan before you start because I had some troubles, but it went away quickly.
            <br><br>
            I was happy with the result.
