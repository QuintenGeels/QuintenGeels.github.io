                In 2022 there was a special week to give attention to bad habits and addiction. You get together as a team and make a physical of digital work to give attention to your cause.
                <br><br>
                We as a team choose to make a game about shoplifting. We make them realize that you never can outrun the police it will only become harder the longer you run.
                <br><br>
                One cool thing is the longer u run the heavier your sentence is. There is one where you do not get accepted in your job because of your theft.
                <br> <br>
                I programmed the game alone because I was the only programmer. My team made the assets and background which where very nicely done. The most important part was the teamwork, and it was amazing everybody was positive and we all where on a straight line. A very cool and fun experience to say the least
